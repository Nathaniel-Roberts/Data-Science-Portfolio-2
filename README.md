## Analysis of an E-commerce Dataset Part 2
This was the second task we completed. To begin with, we had to explore the data, to see what we were dealing with. This involved using .head() and .info(). We then viewed to correlations between all the columns. We then did an analysis on these correlations. We then had to create a hypothesis before Training and Testing the data. After that, we trained a Linear Regression Model. We then visualised, compared and analysed the results.
